This React application demonstrates the implementation of a client-side routing system using `react-router-dom`. The app fetches city data from a backend server and displays it across different pages. Below is a brief overview of the key components and functionality:

### Overview

1. **State Management**:
   - `cities` state holds the fetched city data.
   - `isLoading` state indicates whether the data is currently being loaded.

2. **Data Fetching**:
   - `useEffect` hook fetches city data from `http://localhost:9000/cities` when the component mounts.
   - If the data fetch is successful, it updates the `cities` state. If there is an error, an alert is displayed.

3. **Routing**:
   - **Main Routes**:
     - `/` (HomePage)
     - `/product` (Product)
     - `/pricing` (Pricing)
     - `/login` (Login)
   - **Nested Routes** within the `AppLayout`:
     - Default nested route redirects to `/app/cities`.
     - `/app/cities` (CityList) - Displays a list of cities.
     - `/app/cities/:id` (City) - Displays details for a specific city.
     - `/app/countries` (CountryList) - Displays a list of countries derived from the cities data.
     - `/app/form` (Form) - A form component for additional user input.
   - **Fallback Route**:
     - Any undefined route redirects to the `PageNotFound` component.

### Key Components

- **AppLayout**: Serves as the parent layout for the nested routes under `/app`.
- **CityList**: Displays the list of cities, with `cities` and `isLoading` passed as props.
- **CountryList**: Displays the list of countries, also using `cities` and `isLoading` as props.
- **City**: Displays details of a specific city, accessed via a dynamic route parameter.
- **Form**: A form component for user interaction.
- **PageNotFound**: A fallback component displayed for any undefined routes.

### Example Usage

To run this application, ensure you have the necessary components (HomePage, Product, Pricing, etc.) and a backend server running at `http://localhost:9000` serving the city data.

This setup provides a robust structure for a multi-page React application with nested and dynamic routes, ensuring a smooth navigation experience for the user.
